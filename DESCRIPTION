Description: An implementation of extended Rasch modeling hypothesis testing in R. 
    Provides 4 statistical tests, i.e. gradient test (GR), likelihood ratio test (LR), 
    Rao score or Lagrange multiplier test (RS), and Wald test, for testing a number of 
    hypotheses referring to the Rasch model (RM), linear logistic test model (LLTM), 
    rating scale model (RSM), and partial credit model (PCM).
