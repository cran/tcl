\description{
Returns sample size for Wald (W), likelihood ratio (LR), Rao score (RS)
and gradient (GR) test given probabilities of errors of first and second kinds \eqn{\alpha} and
\eqn{\beta} as well as a deviation from the hypothesis to be tested. The hypothesis to be
tested assumes equal item parameters between two predetermined groups of persons. The alternative assumes
that at least one parameter differs between the two groups.
}
\details{
In general, the sample size is determined from the assumption that the approximate distributions of
the four test statistics are from the family of noncentral \eqn{\chi^2} distributions with \eqn{df}
equal to the number of items minus 1, and noncentrality parameter \eqn{\lambda}. The latter is,
inter alia, a function of the sample size. Hence, the sample size can be determined from the condition
\eqn{\lambda = \lambda_0}, where \eqn{\lambda_0} is a predetermined constant  which depends on the probabilities of
the errors of the first and second kinds \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta}
(or power). More details about the distributions of the test statistics and the relationship between \eqn{\lambda},
power, and sample size can be found in Draxler and Alexandrowicz (2015).

In particular, the determination of \eqn{\lambda} and the sample size, respectively, is based on a simple
Monte Carlo approach. As regards the concept of sample size a distinction between informative and total
sample size has to be made. In the conditional maximum likelihood context, the responses of persons
with minimum or maximum person score are completely uninformative. They do not contribute to the value o
f the test statistic. Thus, the informative sample size does not include these persons. The total sample
size is composed of all persons. The Monte Carlo approach used in the present problem to determine \eqn{\lambda}
and informative (and total) sample size can briefly be described as follows. Data (responses of a large number
of persons to a number of items) are generated given a user-specified scenario of a deviation from the hypothesis
to be tested. The hypothesis to be tested assumes equal item parameters between the two groups of persons.
A scenario of a deviation is given by a choice of the item parameters and the person parameters (to be drawn
randomly from a specified distribution) for each of the two groups. Such a scenario may be called local
deviation since deviations can be specified locally for each item. The relative group sizes are determined by
the choice of the number of person parameters for each of the two groups. For instance, by default \eqn{10^6} person
parameters are selected randomly for each group. In this case, it is implicitly assumed that the two groups of
persons are of equal size. The user can specify the relative groups sizes by choosing the lengths of the
arguments \code{persons1} and \code{persons2} appropriately. Note that the relative group sizes do have an impact on power
and sample size of the tests. The next step is to compute a test statistic \eqn{T} (Wald, LR, score, or gradient)
from the simulated data. The observed value \eqn{t} of the test statistic is then divided by the informative
sample size \eqn{n_{infsim}} observed in the simulated data. This yields the so-called global deviation
\eqn{e = t / n_{infsim}}, i.e., the chosen scenario of a deviation from the hypothesis to be tested being
represented by a single number. Let the informative sample size sought be denoted by \eqn{n_{inf}} (thus, this is
not the informative sample size observed in the sim. data). The noncentrality parameter \eqn{\lambda} can
be expressed by the product \eqn{n_{inf} * e}. Then, it follows from the condition \eqn{\lambda = \lambda_0} that

\deqn{n_{inf} * e = \lambda_0}

and

\deqn{n_{inf} = \lambda_0 / e.}

Note that the sample of size \eqn{n_{inf}} is assumed to be composed only of persons with informative person scores in both groups,
where the relative frequency distribution of these informative scores in each of both groups is considered to be equal
to the observed relative frequency distribution of informative scores in each of both groups in the simulated data. Note also that the
relative sizes of the two person groups are assumed to be equal to the
relative sizes of the two groups in the simulated data. By default, the two groups are equal-sized in the simulated
data, i.e., one yields \eqn{n_{inf} / 2} persons (with informative scores) in each of the two groups. The total
sample size \eqn{n_{total}} is obtained from the relation
\eqn{n_{inf} = n_{total} * pr}, where \eqn{pr} is the proportion or relative frequency of persons observed
in the simulated data with a minimum or maximum score. Basing the tests given a level \eqn{\alpha} on an informative
sample of size \eqn{n_{inf}} the probability of rejecting the hypothesis to be tested will be at least
\eqn{1 - \beta} if the true global deviation \eqn{\ge e}.

Note that in this approach the data have to be generated only once. There are no replications needed. Thus, the
procedure is computationally not very time-consuming.

Since \eqn{e} is determined from the value of the test statistic observed in the simulated data it has to be
treated as a realization of a random variable \eqn{E}. Consequently, \eqn{n_{inf}} is also a realization of a
random variable \eqn{N_{inf}}. Thus, the (realized) value \eqn{n_{inf}} need not be equal to the exact value of
the informative sample size that follows from the user-specified (predetermined) \eqn{\alpha}, \eqn{\beta}, and
scenario of a deviation from the hypothesis to be tested, i.e., the selected item parameters used for the
simulation of the data. If the CML estimates of these parameters computed from the simulated data are close
to the predetermined parameters \eqn{n_{inf}} will be close to the exact value. This will generally be the case
if the number of person parameters used for simulating the data, i.e., the lengths of the vectors \code{persons1}
and \code{persons2}, is large, e.g., \eqn{10^5} or even \eqn{10^6} persons. In such cases, the possible random
error of the computation procedure of \eqn{n_{inf}} based on the sim. data may not be of practical relevance any
more. That is why a large number (of persons for the simulation process) is generally recommended.

For theoretical reasons, the random error involved in computing \eqn{n_{inf}} can be pretty well approximated.
A suitable approach is the well-known delta method. Basically, it is a Taylor polynomial of first order, i.e.,
a linear approximation of a function. According to it the variance of a function of a random variable can be
linearly approximated by multiplying the variance of this random variable with the square of the first
derivative of the respective function. In the present problem, the variance of the test statistic \eqn{T} is
(approximately) given by the variance of a noncentral \eqn{\chi^2} distribution.
Thus, \eqn{Var(T) = 2 (df + 2 \lambda)}, with \eqn{df} equal to the number of items minus 1 and
\eqn{\lambda = t}. Since the global deviation \eqn{e = (1 / n_{infsim}) * t} it
follows for the variance of the corresponding random variable \eqn{E} that \eqn{Var(E) = (1 / n_{infsim})^2 * Var(T)}.
Since \eqn{n_{inf} = f(e) = \lambda_0 / e} one obtains by the delta method (for the variance of the
corresponding random variable \eqn{N_{inf}})

\deqn{Var(N_{inf}) = Var(E) * (f'(e))^2,}

where \eqn{f'(e) = - \lambda_0 / e^2} is the derivative of \eqn{f(e)}. The square root of
\eqn{Var(N_{inf})} is then used to quantify the random error of the suggested Monte Carlo
computation procedure. It is called Monte Carlo error of informative sample size.
