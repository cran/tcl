\title{Test of invariance of item parameters between two groups.}
\usage{
invar_test(X, splitcr = "median", model = "RM")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data matrix.}

\item{splitcr}{Split criterion which is either "mean", "median" or a numeric vector x.
\describe{
 \item{"mean"}{Corresponds to division of the sample according to the mean of the person score.}
 \item{"median"}{Corresponds to division of the sample according to the median of the person score.}
  \item{x}{Has length equal to number of persons and contains zeros and ones. It indicates group membership for every person.}
  }}

\item{model}{RM, PCM, RSM}
}
\value{
A list of test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values.
 \item{test}{A numeric vector of gradient (GR), likelihood ratio (LR), Rao score (RS), and Wald test statistics.}
 \item{df}{A numeric vector of corresponding degrees of freedom.}
 \item{pvalue}{A vector of corresponding p-values.}
 \item{deleted_items}{A list with numeric vectors of item numbers that were excluded before computing corresponding test statistics.}
 \item{call}{The matched call.}
}
\description{
Computes gradient (GR), likelihood ratio (LR), Rao score (RS) and Wald (W) test statistics
  for hypothesis of equality of item parameters between two groups of persons against a two-sided
 alternative that at least one item parameter differs between the two groups.
}
\details{
Note that items are excluded for the computation of GR,LR, and W due to inappropriate
 response patterns within subgroups and for computation of RS due to inappropriate
 response patterns in the total data. If the model is identified from the total data but not from one
 or both subgroups only RS will be computed. If the model is not identified from the total data,
 no test statistic is computable.
